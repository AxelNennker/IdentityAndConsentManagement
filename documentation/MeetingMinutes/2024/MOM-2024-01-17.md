## Redundancy/Overlap between GSMA and CAMARA doc. Duplicated discussions.

- Related issues: #82 "Redundancy with GSMA API General Federated Call Flows document".
- Jesús (Telefónica) points out that some action items are needed and explains the situation and agreements so far. Documentation of NBI-CAMARA API interface, authZ/authN flows, Purpose/Consent management, etc... will be in CAMARA. Jesús considers that no specific action is needed in CAMARA (flows are there), but in GSMA maybe a new github issue is needed to explain the agreement and create a PR in GSMA to avoid overlap, basically simplify flows by referring to CAMARA. GSMA doc will not be as detailed, but will solve overlap and need to include info in 2 places.
- Mark (GSMA) indicates that there are no problems. CAMARA can be the source of truth for northbound interfaces. Decisions may be needed in OGW, then pushed to CAMARA as a recommendation. The recommendation is to define CAMARA and then go back to OGW. Jesús points out that OGW can open issues in CAMARA when requirements come up. Diego (Telefónica) explains agreements in TSC and suggests moving forward with removing duplicate information from GSMA. Shilpa (DT) agrees.
- Mark expresses concern about getting good references back into CAMARA from PRDs.
- Way forward agreed is to open issue in GSMA to do cleanup to remove duplicate parts.

## CAMARA/OGW OIDC Profile.

- Related issues: #78 "clarify the "credentials" notion in CIBA workflow authentication" & #90 "OIDC guidance (what needs to be adhered to?)".
- Dawid (DT) notes that the OIDC profile should cover some parts that are not very detailed in current flows, such as Client authentication. Details on /authorize and /token call. There is a big need to use something standardized across MNOs, Dawid suggests using Mobile Connect (MC) profile.
- Guido (Telefónica) points out that going through the OIDF process will take years, so we should avoid that and define our own profile. Guido points out that Telefónica has volunteered to prepare a first draft of a detailed document describing all the points that are still open and/or open to interpretation. Telefónica is working on it and can share the proposal in a few weeks.
- Fabio (Telefónica) who participated in Mobile Connect points out that their profile has a lot of things on top of the standard and it's not a good idea to start from there. It's better to start from scratch in CAMARA. Dawid points out that in terms of scope, MC does not add any limitation and considers it better to reuse something that already works.
- Jesus tries to show that the positions are actually closer. TEF suggests to start with a draft for CAMARA and use MC as a good valid reference.
- Dawid shows the existing MC profile, and their Fabio points out some things on top of the OIDC standard like version being mandatory, or acr_values being mandatory, or sample scope being mc_xxx.
- David points out that we can take the specs and see the delta and close it to match the CAMARA characteristics.
- Fabio points out that adapting the MC profile means checking all the non-standard options in MC to see if they match in CAMARA. So it's better to start from scratch as MC has several attributes that are not standard.
- Shilpa indicates that she thinks the parts are actually saying the same thing, but from different starting points: define own CAMARA profile, not include default options from other profiles, use existing profile as inspiration. She suggests to start with a PR and discuss on that PR.
Mark comments on the same line.
- Jesús indicates that Telefónica will contribute with the profile draft as indicated in previous WG meetings (see AP `20231129-02`) to have the CAMARA profile version. And with the compromise of reusing everything that is valid from MC. Jesús asks if the group is okay. Shilpa asks about the timeline for input. Jesús cannot confirm online, but should be a matter of weeks.
- Way forward agreed: Telefónica will contribute to CAMARA with a first draft of the OIDC profile.

## New participant assignment to chair the working group.

- Jesús points out that it will be asked to rotate the chairmanship of the working group. It would be healthy and positive for the working group activities if another participant from another company could take over from Jesús as chair. Jesús doesn't know if there is a formal procedure in CAMARA governance (will check), but in any case, this issue will be raised in the coming days on the WG maillist and/or github. Any candidate is welcome.

| [#88](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/88) | Deutsche Telekom AG | **Creating the first release for id and consent subproject**<br><li>Elizabeth (Ericsson) asks if issues that need clarification in the text should go to v0.2 or is there a chance to have them in 0.1. Jesus (Telefónica) explains the TSC decision and agreement that new issues will not block 0.1. If any can be resolved today, they will be included in 0.1, otherwise they will be moved to 0.2.<li>Shilpa (DT) explains TSC decision and agreement to have v0.1 and baseline, and indicates that v0.2 can be done soon and can focus on clarifications. Elizabeth notes that clarifications can go to 0.2 and then improvements can go to 0.3.<li>Jesus points out that the only missing piece to generate the 0.1 release is issue #92. There is a PR (#109) created by Eric (Vodafone) to add a statement about how scopes are constructed when using client credentials. It has already been approved by Telefónica (Jesús). Shilpa (DT) has checked and is also fine with the PR, but Rafal is on vacation. There is agreement to merge PR #109, close issue #92 and generate release v0.1 from this commit. And then move to have a release 0.2 with clarifications soon.<li>Shilpa suggests having a label for issues that are candidates to be fixed in v0.2 (if needed). Jesus takes the AP. |

| [#100](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/100) | Ericsson | **Claims to be used in oAuth Access tokens**<br><li>Jesús explains Telefonica's [position](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/100#issuecomment-1895152957) on this issue.<li>Regarding scope, Elizabeth (Ericsson) points out that the purpose should not be included in the response (scope field of OAuth). Points out that the combination of purpose and scope is something we invented.<li>Pedro (Telefónica) points out that there is no explicit solution in the OAuth2 specification for sending the purpose. The solution in OAuth is to use the scope. What we have done is define a format to define the scope to deal with purpose and the consent handling. So considers this to be fully aligned with the OAuth2 spec.<li>Elizabeth does not disagree that this is not technically possible.<li>...<li>_<Discussion between Pedro and Elizabeth about whether or not to return the scope with the format defined in CAMARA, and specifically requested by the API client in the token request.>_<li>...<li>We are running out of time, so the discussion has to continue offline.<li>Jesús summarizes the scenarios: On one hand, from Telefónica's point of view, we should not standardize the access token claims as they should be opaque to the API client as per standard. The access token is internal to the Operator Auth server. The information associated with the access token, its format, or whether the access token is actually a self-contained JWT or if it is just a unique string and the information is stored in the auth server DDBB, etc... all of this is dependent on the operator implementation and each operator can implement it according to their own solution. It is outside the scope of CAMARA. But on the other hand, if we want to provide to the API client the information about the scopes that has been granted and under what purpose, what Telefonica suggest is to use [scope](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.2) parameter in /token endpoint response. Basically, you can provide the requested scope (dpv:xxx#yyyy which includes the purpose) and in case of using "api-name", the extended list of technical scopes defined in the API Spec YAML file. |
