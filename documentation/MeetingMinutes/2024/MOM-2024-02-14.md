## Meeting Technicallities

Jesús offered that ownership of the meeting invite could be transferred to the new chair. Axel said that for now this can stay as it is.
Jesús points out that the current owner of the meeting invitation (Jose Antonio Ordoñez Lucena) is leaving the company, and it might make sense for Axel, as moderator, to have his own meeting invitation under his control. Because the meeting invitation may be left uncontrolled (no possibility to change the schedule, etc.) once Jose Antonio leaves and we may need to create a new meeting invitation anyway.


## Discussion on Consensus in Camara Working Groups

Recapitulation of the previous discussion on this topic: Jesús and Diego said there was consensus achieved during a WG call that we continue working on https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/113
Herbert said that lazy-consensus is the Camara way. Shilpa said no consensus was achieved. 
Axel proposed that consensus should be achieved on Github because not everybody can attend meetings. Diego said that is not the Camara way and all CAMARA subprojects actually make decisions during the calls, and active WG participants are well aware of this.
Shilpa proposed that if there is an important decision suggested to be made at the next meeting, then this should be communicated a few days before the meeting. So, that people know about the importance of the next meeting and attend when otherwise they would not attend.
We agreed that is must be clear whether consensus is achieved or not, and that we need to get better on this.

## Discussion the Way Forward regarding the Profile

Jesús recapitulated the last meeting where PR #113 was discussed and that consensus was achieved.
Axel and Shilpa did not agree with consensus beeing achieved - see previous section.
Axel said that he created the issue https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/122 and kindly asked WG members to comment on the issue.
Axel also created PR https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/121 and asked people to review it.

After some discussion we agreed that WG members comment on the issue and review the PR seeking resolution and a decision whether to use the DT proposal or the TEF proposal as our WG's policy document.
Elizabeth suggested that if discussions on GitHub get too long, we would call for a side meeting, anounce it on the mailing this and seek consensus.

Axel agreed with this proposal and no objections where heard.

Axel asked Bjorn Hjelm for his/OIDF's opinion. Bjorn said that OIDF is here to help.

We agreed that if neither the commenting on the issue nor the review of the PR lead to consensus, the WG seek a vote at TSC.


## Discussion about offline-access

Jesús said that this PR "just" moves documentation from some place (GSMA) to another and that this WG agreed on moving documentation to Camara as the "place of truth" for both GSMA and Camara.
And example was given that some Commonalities document was moved to ICM and this is similar. Shilpa objected that moving a document from Camara to Camara is different.
Axel asked meeting attendents to describe the Camara use case for offline-access and comment on the PR why Camara needs offline-access in ICM.
Diego pointed out that ICM already has a document that talks about refresh tokens.
Axel replyied that OIDC offline-access is only offline-access to the user-info endpoint and that refresh tokens are a different thing.
Diego said that he personally is not for or against this PR but that this PR just follows the "move documentation to Camara"-plan.
We agreed that reviews should be written.

## Closing Remarks

Axel kindly asked participants to comment on issues and to review PRs and most importantly contribute text changes to PR.
WGs thrive only if members become participants. So, again please participate. Please comment and review.
