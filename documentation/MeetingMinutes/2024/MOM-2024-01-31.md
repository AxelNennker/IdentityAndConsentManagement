## New participant assignment to chair the working group.

- It is announced that Axel Nennker (DT) will take over the chair from the next working group meeting. He replaces Jesús Peña (Telefónica).
- Jesús and Telefónica will continue to actively contribute to the working group.
- In his new role, Axel is also proposed to replace Rafal Artych in CODEOWNERS as DT representative. 

## CAMARA/OGW OIDC Profile.

- **Related issues**: #78 "clarify the "credentials" notion in CIBA workflow authentication", #90 "OIDC guidance (what needs to be adhered to?)" & #104 "Alignment of Client Credential authentication / authorization using API Gateway Pattern".
- First contribution sent by Telefónica in PR #113, there are many comments in the proposal. Each comment cannot be reviewed in the call, so Jesús proposes to discuss the two main lines of discussion:
1. Format of the profile: Delta (only difference from standards, otherwise reference) vs. self-contained (include all relevant information).
2. Scope of the profile: Suggestion from TEF is to have a first proposal showing the short term solution and include that in v0.2 as per [pull/113#discussion_r1471994271](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/113#discussion_r1471994271). Release v0.3 will include further improvements in areas not yet covered.

- Shilpa (DT) points out that purpuse short-term solution is already documented in CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md and if some topics are not covered in the profile, then we will not benefit from the existing document that we have in v0.1. Jesús clarifies that the profile contains relevant information that is not part of CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md that is being requested by other CAMARA participants for their current implementations such as the client authtentication, CIBA login_hint, error scenarios, etc.
- Shilpa mentions that the removal of single scope restrictions is already marked as a candidate for v0.2. Jesús clarifies that this corresponds to issue [#87](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/87), which is not marked as a candidate for v0.2. It will be part of the enhancement discussion for v0.3.
- Discussion about scope of v0.2, whether to include things that are evolving features or new features or just clarifications of things that are open to interpretation. Jan (Ericsson) confirms same interpretation as Telefónica that v0.2 is just for clarifications. Also recalls TSC minutes saying the same thing.
- Shilpa points out that the profile should at least cover things that will be in v0.2. Jesús points out that some items are enhancements, so they are not marked for v0.2. Shilpa points out that she needs to go through the candidate items for v0.2 and see if DT thinks there is anything urgent that needs to be in v0.2.
- **Will await Shilpa's feedback, but it's proposed to use a first version of OIDC profile as an appropriate way to cover current picture and such urgent issues targeted for v0.2**

<br>

- Elizabeth comments on PR #113. Points out that the text is a bit inconsistent, and even though it shows the current solution, the text may need to be revised to make it clearer. Elizabeth notes that there is a list of items in the PR with inconsistent text that should be fixed. Jesús points out that it's good, and if it is, it should be fixed. Her contribution to the PR is welcome.
- Elizabeth points out that the Client Credentials flow and purpose usage should be reviewed. Jesús points out that this was discussed in an issue opened by Vodafone (issue #92), so after discussion this was the conclusion: Client Credentials can be used only when no personal user data is processed, so purpose does not apply. Elizabeth points out the purpose might be charging relevant. Jesús points out that it's a great point, but since there is an agreement, it should go to v0.3. Elizabeth agrees.
- Axel asks for clarification on whether scope is not needed or purpose is not needed. Clarified that scope is always required. Axel asks if charging models can be differentiated by different scopes and Elizabeth points out that it's not possible. Candidate to be discussed in v0.3.

<br>

Regarding 1) "Format of the profile":
- Axel points out that the main argument against a self-contained format is that it's very difficult to see what changes the standard. Points out that if we have a full document, we should clearly identify each change that changes/updates/deviates the standard.
- Jesús points out that Telefónica first has tried to create a profile like Mobile Connect (which is self-contained), as requested in recent calls. On the other hand, Telefónica thinks that if we add references to standards and then the standard is not completely clear on a topic, different topics may have different interpretations. We have had this problem in the past. In any case, we agree that it does not make sense to copy everything from another reused standard, but only the relevant parts.
- Axel will be fine with a note at the beginning explaining why we do it one way or the other. For example, explain that "if we repeat redirect_url and it's not clearly marked as different, a reader will have to go to auth2 to check if the text is the same or has changed". Indicates that if we choose to repeat, we should clearly indicate what has changed. Indicates that FAPI goes a different way, just with certain restrictions.
- Shilpa indicates that she has no other opinion. Probably pros and cons of each option. Elizabeth would vote for a self-contained with a list of changes (change history), otherwise it wouldn't be possible to follow. Axel points out that if you're a developer reading this, you won't notice what's changed from the existing standard. Elizabeth points out that with a delta it's going to be impossible, she has 20 years experience in development.... Axel has been working in standards for 10 years, and mistakes happen, he thinks that if you rewrite something, you might invalidate the other standard.
- Toyeeb (GSMA) indicates that a self-contained document will be more appreciated by dev community, based on current experience with developers so far in GSMA.
- Axel points out that it's fine as long as it's clear what changes are included and why. He warns that we need to be really careful. Fabio points out that maybe we can point out the text that changes from the standard, he agrees with Axel in this case
- **After asking to the WG participants considering the different opinions, the way forward agreed is:  go with self-contained + compromise to properly note any change in relation to the reused standard.**

| [#100](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/100) | Ericsson | **Claims to be used in oAuth Access tokens**<br><li>Jesús explains that everyone seems to agree that the access token must be opaque from the client's point of view. Regarding the format, JWT or others, Telefónica feels that it shouldn't be standardized, it's up to the operator.<li>Elizabeth points out that if we keep the options open, when vendors provide the CAMARA implementations, it needs to be clear which options to use. She also points out that the resulting content bound to the token must be standardized, e.g.: scopes and purposes, how they are conveyed.<li>Jesús points out that if his understanding is correct, Ericsson is fine with not standardizing the token format implementation, but it needs to standardize the information associated with the access token. Elizabeth confirms.<li>Pedro (Telefonica) indicates that he understands what Elizabeth means. API implementation needs some way to know information about a token, APIGW needs some system to validate ATs (permissions to call API). But indicates that it's not a problem that one operator makes one decision and another makes another, an operator can decide to include in JWT info or in database the information, choosing the fields.<li>Mark points out that when we talked about aggregators, the flows were talking about self-contained tokens that embed other tokens. He wonders if changing that would have an impact. Jesús clarifies that the GSMA aggregation flows also specify that it is an implementation decision whether to use jwt or other approaches such as database. Mark indicates that his concern is that CAMARA APIs can still work in federation. It is clarified that it can still work.<br><br> Time is up, remaining topics will continue offline.|
