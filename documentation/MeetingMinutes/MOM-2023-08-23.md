## Issues and PRs

### Review PR [#54](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/54)

-Telefonica summarises what PR covers, its status in terms of existing discussions and support:

This PR is intended to address the AP `20230712-02` (see [MOM-2023-07-12.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-07-12.md) && [MOM-2023-07-26.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-07-26.md)) raised weeks ago about including the information related to the CAMARA APIs access flows in the `user-consent.md` document. It was requested that this information be included as soon as possible to serve as a reference for everyone and for a better understanding of the ongoing discussions in the Working Group.

It also fixes Issue #46 so CIBA flow can be referenced from the the AuthN-AuthZ document and Issue #52 including the technical ruleset for frontend and backend flows.


-Jesus (Telefonica) proposes to merge PR.<br>-Shilpa (DT) states that she has already agreed and points out that the sooner the merge, the better. So asks if it's possible to know when this will be merged.<br>-**It is agreed to merge the PR by 30/8 as a deadline, a comment will be included in the PR to indicate this.**

### Review PR [#55](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/55)

-Telefonica summarises what PR covers, its status in terms of existing discussions and support:

This PR is intended to extend AuthN-AuthZ doc with the details about network based authN. It fixes Issue #45.

-Jesus (Telefonica) proposes to merge PR.<br>-Klaus (Vodafone) points out that it may not be possible to identify the user. The point is that you can't identify who the user is, it could be another user, for example if my phone is being used by my father. Klaus feels that this should be identification and not authentication.<br>-Telefonica disagrees. Diego (Telefónica) points out that network-based authentication is just one of many authentication methods that exist. And, of course, each of them has a different level of assurance based on the factors it relies on to verify a user's identity.<br>-Jesús (Telefonica) also points out that we need to differentiate between "end user" and "user" (operator subscriber), which is also further clarified in [PR #54](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/dce151e901c7d3c7f4a875fc5cf04053e08efb45/documentation/user-consent.md?plain=1#L46), as this topic has been raised in the past. From an operator perspective, the operator can authenticate the operator subscriber (user) who also has a unique identifier (sub in OIDC) on the operator side. Usually the user is the end user, but this is not always the case. For example, a parent may be the user of a mobile phone subscription for their children.<br>Shilpa (DT) asks to add Klaus (Vodafone) as a reviewer as well as Axel (DT). Robert Ludovic (Orange) also asks to add Sebastian (Orange). This is done in the call itself.

| **Issue** | Owner | Description |
| ----------| ----- | ----------- |
| **Open issues** |  |  | 
| [#15](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/15) | GSMA/Vonage | **Subscriber Identity API**<br> -Jesús (Telefonica) refers to the existing action item from 26/7 (`20230726-01`) to split this issue into different ones. Action item has not been addressed.<br>-During summer break Telefonica validated with Privacy Guardian and Security team and indicated in the issue that proposal is not acceptable, also Shilpa (DT) confirm has the same view as stated in the issue.<br>-Shilpa suggests to write a comment that if no further comments are added here, the issue will be closed as stale issue, as it was agreed to open different issues if needed. Jesús nods and points out that [the comment added today by Telefonica](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/15#issuecomment-1689938549) is basically aligned with what she is suggesting.<br>-**It is agreed to close it, but since Chris (Vonage) is not on the call, a message will be written in the issue with this information and it will be closed by 30/08 as deadline.** | 
| [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/21) ([PR#33](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/33))| Deutsche Telekom AG | **Definition of scenarios for consent management**<br> No updates about this issue other topics being prioritized. |
| [#32](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/32) | Orange | **The concept of purpose**<br> -Status of the problem explained. Telefonica has sent the solution for a representative use case and asks Orange about their proposal.<br>-Jan (Ericsson) points out that the issue has been discussed for a long time and has expanded from the concept of purpose to the way it is used, the relationship to scopes, etc.<br>-Robert Ludovic (Orange) says that they don't agree with the approach. Orange fully agrees that the concept of purpose is necessary to cover the legal basis, but does not agree that the opengateway product is linked to a purpose. So as they don't agree with that assumption, which is stated in the scenario, they can't provide a solution based on that assumption. So the suggestion is to let Orange's proposal specify different assumptions if needed.<br>-Orange believes that it is better to agree on the business scenario first before going into the details of the technical solution.<br>-Telefonica states that the technical solution should be flexible enough as the business may change at some point.<br>-Orange indicates that when Sebastian is back, by the end of this week, information will be added to the issue.<br>Telefonica also clarifies that the intention is not to define how each operator should implement this internally, in terms of architectural details, entities defined in their internal data model, etc. As long as the authorisation request is the same for developers, regardless of which operator is serving the request, and as long as it is decoupled from the definition of the scope of the API specifications.<br>-Shilpa indicates that DT is fine with the current proposal from Telefonica |
