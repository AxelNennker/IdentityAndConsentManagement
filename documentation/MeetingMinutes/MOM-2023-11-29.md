## Issues and PRs

| **Issue** | Owner | Description |
| ----------| ----- | ----------- |
| **Closed issues** |  |  |
| N/A |  |  |
| **New issues** |  |  |
| [#84](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/84) | Centillion | **Implement a Future-Proof Dynamic, Geolocation-Based User Consent Mechanism Compliant with Global Privacy Regulations**<br>Transferred from camaraproject/Governance.<br>Not covered on today's call. The issue owner (Nicholas Venezia - Centillion) was not present on the call.  This matter will be taken offline. |
| [#85](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/85) | Singtel | **Recommendation for OIDC Java provider libraries**<br>Feedback from Telefónica provided on github comments. The only feedback provided so far. It was agreed to continue this topic offline. |
| [#87](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/87) | Ericsson | **Extending the technical scope from one technical scope to a parameters list of technical scopes.**<br>It corresponds to a mid-term proposal from Ericsson to convey purpose and data scope on the access token request. No Ericcson representatives attended the meeting to explain the proposal further, and there has been no feedback on github so far. This issue will then be taken offline. Telefónica points out that, as mentioned in the past, it is really important to receive the valuable feedback from the OpenID Foundation (OIDF) for these mid-term proposals. |
| [#88](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/88) | Deutsche Telekom AG | **Creating the first release for id and consent subproject**<br>The Issue owner (Shilpa - Deutsche Telekom AG) does not join the call. Rafal (Deutsche Telekom AG), on behalf of Shilpa, points out that in this issue we can indicate which PRs/issues must be merged/fixed to close the release. Then the release can be created. Jesús will provide a comment indicating that from Telefónica's side it is ok to create a first release v0.1 with closed agreements, guidelines and rule sets. However, the Security Scheme topic must also be closed and included, then the Release can be created. |

| [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/21) ([PR#74](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/74)) `Draft`| Deutsche Telekom AG | **Definition of scenarios for consent management**<br>It is on hold at the moment. No updates from last call. |
| [#57](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/57) ([PR#62](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/62)) `Draft` | Telefonica | **Align securitySchemes and security of CAMARA API specs with IdentityAndConsentManagement WG**<br>As concluded by the TSC, it has already been agreed to use the openId connect securityScheme in the Open API Specification (OAS). This is something that must be applied in all API subprojects. Telefonica has the action point to provide some wording to be included as part of the API Specification to indicate to potential API customers why we are not listing specific grant types in the Specification, and how to discover which authorisation flows they are allowed to use. Telefónica's initial proposed wording was submitted two weeks ago and is available at [issues/57#issuecomment-1813106499.](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/57#issuecomment-1813106499). No feedback has been received so far. It is recalled that this is a priority issue and WG participants are encouraged to provide their feedback so that this issue can be closed as soon as possible and the API subprojects can adapt their API specifications accordingly. |
| [#69](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/69) | Vonage | **Chapter 6 - Front-end flow authorisation flow unauthenticated**<br> As per 04/10 WG call, this issue will be discussed in the context of the GSMA technical stream, and anything that needs to be piggybacked into CAMARA will be raised later for everyone in CAMARA to review. |
| [#70](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/70) ([PR#86](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/86)) | Vonage | **Chapter 6 - Front-end flow PII leakage?**<br>Telefónica created PR #86 2 weeks ago to address this issue. This PR replicates the changes made in the GSMA documentation https://github.com/GSMA-Open-Gateway/Open-Gateway-Documents/pull/61, which fixed https://github.com/GSMA-Open-Gateway/Open-Gateway-Documents/issues/53. Issue #70 was a clone of GSMA Issue 53.<br>As agreed, issue #70 was discussed in the context of the GSMA technical stream. And if something needs to be piggybacked into CAMARA, it will be raised later for everyone in CAMARA to review. As a result, this PR replicates the same changes that were merged into the GSMA documentation.<br>PR has not received any comments or reviews so far, Telefónica has requested reviews from WG participants, expecting a quick merge as it was already discussed and agreed in GSMA. |
| [#72](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/72) | GSMA | **Have we reached a final ruleset in defining the usage of 2 and 3 legged tokens**<br>As discussed in the previous WG call (15/11 - [meeting minutes](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-11-15.md)), the rest of the WG participants were encouraged to review the issue and check if further action is needed in the documentation to avoid misunderstandings. Or if the issue should otherwise be closed. There have been no objections in the last two weeks, concluding that the existing documentation is 100% clear to WG participants on the use of 3-legged vs. 2-legged access. The issue will be closed after the call.  |
| [#78](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/78) | Orange | **clarify the "credentials" notion in CIBA workflow authentication**<br><li>Sebastian (Orange) asks what is the conclusion of the issue.<li>Jesús (Telefónica) indicates that the proposal is to define an OIDC profile (developer oriented) to fully specify this issue and other similar ones that have been raised in CAMARA and GSMA technical stream. For this particular issue, the standard allows both cases (client secret and private_key_jwt), the profile should clarify it.<li>Jesús asks the audience if they think this profile will be useful. <li>Robert (Orange) asks where the profile will be<li>Jesús indicates that it should be in GSMA as it is related to OpenGateway and eventually CAMARA could be used outside the OpenGateway context. <li>Robert asks if the way forward is to close this issue and open an issue in the GSMA tech stream to create the OIDC profile with this topic and other things raised.<li>Jesús indicates that Telefonica is volunteering to create a first draft of this profile, but it's important that other parties contribute (especially the WG participants who raised it).<li>Mark (GSMA) indicates that this sounds like a good proposal<li>Robert nods.<li> Mark asks where the document will be, whether a document in CAMARA saying "if you want to use CAMARA APIs in OGW you have to follow this profile" or directly in GSMA PRD or equivalent.<li>Jesús indicates that Telefónicas's position is to have this in GSMA, but it should be public.<li>Mark points out that PRD will be public, but github can't be public. Mark agrees that we need to be very specific for OGW, discussions in github are private now, we can discuss making it public later.<li>Jesús points out that it would be great to have OIDF involved in this<li> Rafal (Deutsche Telekom AG) nods and points out that it would be good to have a profile, but a CAMARA profile, not necessarily an OGW profile; define the credentials and the scope.<li>Jesús points out that it's still an OGW profile.<br><br>CAMARA participants tend to agree that there should be an OIDC profile where these developer-oriented implementation details are written down in black and white. But it is still not resolved where to put it. This is also related to issue #82. |
| [#79](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/79) ([PR#89](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/89)) | T-Mobile US | **Recommend removal of associating 'proof possession' with PKCE**<br>Deutsche Telekom AG (Shilpa) created PR #89 to fix this problem. Jesús mentions that from Telefónica's point of view the PR is ok as the changes are in line with the standard (RFC7636) and it has enough approvals. PR is a candidate for merging. The owner of this issue (Murthy Gorty - T-Mobile US) did not join the call. Murat explains on his behalf that he is now OOO, issue will be closed when double checked that T-Mobile US is ok with it. |
| [#82](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/82) | Orange | **Redundancy with GSMA API General Federated Call Flows document**<br>Telefónica's proposal is to keep the documentation in the GSMA only. As it is related to OpenGateway and eventually CAMARA could be used outside the OpenGateway context. Robert (Orange) agrees. CAMARA should focus on API definitions. GSMA should focus on OpenGateway end-to-end integration (auth, telco finder/routing, aggregation flows, etc). However, the documentation should be accessible to all, as this is a concern raised several times in the past by CAMARA participants. If there is a specific 'Opengateway requirement for CAMARA', it can be managed as a commonality. Mark (GSMA) indicates that he understands the challenge. |
