| **Closed issues** |  |  |
| N/A |  |  |
| **New issues** |  |  |
| [#59](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/59) | Orange | **documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md diagram update purpose/scope**<br> Documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md diagrams should be updated for POST/ authorize to use `scope` word instead of `purpose` word. A new PR will be created once we get agreement on issue #32. This new PR will correct the flow accordingly, and include the information about the agreed solution in the relevant doc sections. |
| [#63](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/63) | Deutsche Telekom AG | **Usage of OAUTH2.0 client credentials in SimSwap API**<br> Moved to SIM Swap project as requested by Shilpa (DT). However, it was clarified that this issue actually stems from a discussion in the SIM Swap subproject where it was requested to move the discussion to this WG in order to clarify the agreed guidelines regarding the use of client credentials in CAMARA API access. The issue will be moved back to this WG and it is agreed to close it, as it is already clarified in the issue comments that client credentials do not apply to the SIM Swap API, nor to any other API processing personal user data. Dawid (DT) pointed out that in his opinion the introduction of CIBA into SimSwap looks like a "downgrade" of existing solutions that customers are using. But CIBA flow fits perfectly for the mass market,so it should be fine for CAMARA.<br>Issue will be moved back to this WG and CLOSED according to what is mentioned above.  |

| [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/21) ([PR#33](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/33))| Deutsche Telekom AG | **Definition of scenarios for consent management**<br> No updates about this issue from last call. |
| [#32](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/32) ([PR#64](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/64)) | Orange | **The concept of purpose**<br> There is still no agreement on the technical solution to declare a "purpose" when accessing the CAMARA API. This issue is already becoming a development bottleneck and needs to be resolved sooner rather than later. Telefonica proposes to set a deadline to try to find an agreement or an intermediate solution between the proposal of Telefonica and Orange. Hopefully we manage to do so, this is the desired way. But if there is no final agreement, it would be necessary to vote it according to CAMARA governance rules.<br>New PR #64 opened by Robert Ludovic (Orange) including a table to compare both solutions. Telefonica will complete it by Friday (22/09), then DT will review and add comments, maybe add new columns.<br>**Deadline will be the end of next week: 29/09. If no agreement is reached, the voting process would be organized for the week of 02/10.** |
| [#45](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/45) ([PR#55](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/55)) | Deutsche Telekom AG | **Add missing details in authN-authZ doc**<br> To be closed as soon as PR #55 is merged. Telefonica clarifies that the original goal of this issue and PR was to include some information about network based authentication in the `CAMARA-AuthN-AuthZ-Concept.md` document. This type of authentication is specifically mentioned in the Number Verify API and it was decided to include the related information in this WG for any CAMARA participant to use as a reference. Network-based authentication is a requirement for the operator, and the specific mechanism used (based on IP, header encryption, etc.) is up to the operator. This is not something to standardize here. The current changes provided by PR #55 should already cover this issue. However, Dawid (DT) points to his comments in the PR regarding the topic that with HE (Header Enrichment) HTTP is involved and therefore may not work, at least the developer needs to be aware of that. Fair point, should be considered. So PR will be revisited for further clarification on this topic. |
| [#46](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/46) | Deutsche Telekom AG | **Extend AuthN-AuthZ doc with detailed CIBA flow description**<br> No updates on this issue since last call. It is agreed to be closed in view of the [added reference](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/61) in the `CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md` document pointing to the CIBA standard and the CIBA flow already included in the `CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md` document. |
| [#57](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/57) ([PR#62](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/62)) | Telefonica | **Align securitySchemes and security of CAMARA API specs with IdentityAndConsentManagement WG**<br> Jesus (Telefonica) explains proposal to have default OpenIDConnect and only clarify specific scenarios like those that only allow AuthCode (Number Verify) or APIs where personal info is not managed according to legal&privacy teams so Client Credentials is included. In short, the proposal is to include exceptions, but by default have a commonality, which will be OpenIDConnect, to allow flexibility. And then have the inventory to be able to include a recommended flow.<br>Proposal to be outlined by Jesús in issue, to be reviewed by others and move forward. |

## AoB

- Next call schedule: 3rd Oct. 2023
- Shilpa (DT) suggests to have a discussion to include in CAMARA the means to capture the explicit consent. Even if it's not an API, Shilpa points out that it's relevant. It will be proposed in TSC to extend the scope of Identity&Consent to cover this issue. Jesús (Telefonica) clarifies that perhaps specific means should not be standardized in CAMARA, but discussion on options can take place. Intention is to gather input and insights
