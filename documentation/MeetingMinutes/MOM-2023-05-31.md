| [#17](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/17) | Deutsche Telekom AG | **Remove term NaaS**<br> Closed two weeks ago. Suggestion from DT (Shilpa) to remove the term NaaS was considered and included in the baseline document as part of the [PR#13](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/13). |

| [#28](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/28) | TMUS | **Baseline - Using purpose parameter in the authorization request -feedback**<br> Closed last week and input incorporated into baselined document as part of the [PR#13](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/13). |
| **New issues** |  |  |
| [#31](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/31) | Centillion | **Open ID - historical user profiles**<br> Following DT's comments on github, it is agreed to close the issue. |
| [#32](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/32) | Orange | **The concept of purpose**<br> GSMA: There is concern about the actual need to define a purpose. <br> TEF: The Operator, as the data controller, is required [by law](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) to control the purpose of the processing of personal data.<br> VF: same concern. Even if purpose is granted for security reasons, we (operator) cannot control if the application decides to use it for other purposes. <br> TEF: That's true, but the duty of the operator is to grant access under what's legally written in the purposes. Then, if the application does something else different from what's declared in the purpose, then it's their responsability. That process must be logged and audited in case there is any problem. <br> VF: Is the plan to standardize purposes? TEF nods. VF don't share the need to go for standardization with regards to purposes. They noted some examples of ISVs. <br> TEF: purpose will be mapped to a set of scopes, each associated to specific action. <br> MSFT: As we're not able to anticipate for what this application will use the API, it may not be a good idea to restrict upfront with the purpose concept.. <br> DT: If we look at GDPR, one of the key parameters is purpose. The idea of standardizing purpose -> W3C has made good progress. We also  need to agree upon which CAMARA APIs will require explicit consent, and then involve our privacy/legal teams. DT will take action and create a new issue. |
