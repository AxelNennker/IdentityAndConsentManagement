## Nicholas Venezia (Centillion) presentation

- Nick provides a high-level overview of Centillion's Consent Management Framework and Consent & Measurements APIs family.
- Tanja (Nokia) points out that the framework presented doesn't seem to be in the scope of CAMARA.
- Nick explains that Centillion wants to understand the needs of operators and CAMARA and leverage Consent Management with the Centillion framework.
- Jesús (Telefónica) explains that the aforementioned API family would not be exposed by operators like the CAMARA APIs, but by a "central" consent management framework, which would be the Centillion platform. This is not within the scope of CAMARA and there is no such "central" consent management system. Operators have strong requirements to be in control of consent and not delegate it to third parties. Centillion's approach seems to fit for those operators that do not have a consent management solution (in-house or provided by a vendor), but not for the scope of CAMARA (as Tanja mentioned, CAMARA is not an execution platform).
- Nick is encouraged to contribute to this CAMARA working group and provide his valuable feedback based on Centillion's current expertise. His feedback is more than welcome. Nick is also encouraged to share any relevant information he would like to share about today's presentation on the WG mailing list for everyone's information. And also he is suggested to raise any issue in the WG project with any proposal Centillion may have for CAMARA participants to review.

| [#80](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/80) | GSMA | ~~**Can the use of purpose in authorisation request be considered stable?**~~<br>`CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md` document is the result of the short term agreement reached on Issue #32 and must be considered the current stable position on what refers to purpose declaration in the authorization process. |
| **New issues** |  |  |
| [#78](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/78) | Orange | **clarify the "credentials" notion in CIBA workflow authentication**<br> Issue opened by Orange to specify the client authentication that must be supported in CAMARA. (client_secret, private_key_jwt).<br>- Ludovic (Orange) comments that in the Spanish champion this issue was raised and some telcos have one auth mechanism and others have another different mechanism and it may be that the partners/aggregators only want to have one or can only work with one.<br>- Jesús (Telefónica) points out that these kinds of questions, which are open in CAMARA (and also in GSMA), actually may point to a need that has not yet been met. It looks like there may be a need for an Open Gateway / CAMARA profile/binding documenting what are the mandatory parameters in the authorisation requests, what are the error codes and error scenarios, what is the client authentication supported, what are the login hint methods supported for CIBA, etc... And this profile/binding should be in one place to avoid having to maintain more than one reference documentation, as also reported in issue #82.<br>- Axel (DT) comments on work in Financial APIs - https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI-CIBA_OPs<br>- Eric (Vodafone) comments that he is in favour of defining a profile but that it would only apply to the final consumer of the API. |
| [#79](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/79) | T-Mobile US | **Recommend removal of associating 'proof possession' with PKCE**<br> No updates for this topic, other topics are prioritised. The owner of this issue (Murthy Gorty - T-Mobile US) did not join the call. |
| [#82](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/82) | Orange | **Redundancy with GSMA API General Federated Call Flows document**<br> We ran out of time on the call. The issue raised by Robert Ludovic is very important. Call participants agree that it needs to be addressed as it is already a pain point that information is partially overlapped in GSMA and CAMARA.<br><br>- Jesús (Telefónica)  fully agrees and clarifies that the CAMARA document does not include information on GSMA Open Gateway architectural components (such as Telco Finder) or information on aggregators and/or aggregation flow specifics. However, there is significant overlap as the CAMARA NBI information is the same in both places. CAMARA specific NBI flows have been requested by the WG in the past to be documented in CAMARA as a public repository.<br><br>- Toyeeb (GSMA) also points out that GSMA documentation is intended to be public as PRD documents, but this would take time. |

| [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/21) ([PR#74](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/74))| Deutsche Telekom AG | **Definition of scenarios for consent management**<br>It is on hold at the moment. No updates from last call. |
| [#57](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/57) ([PR#62](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/62)) | Telefonica | **Align securitySchemes and security of CAMARA API specs with IdentityAndConsentManagement WG**<br> This issue was discussed at the TSC 2023-10-19 meeting and the conclusions and next steps agreed can be found at [TSC-2023-10-19-Meeting-Minutes.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/TSC/TSC-2023-10-19-Meeting-Minutes.md#commonalities--icm)<br>Agreement to use the openId connect discovery clause in the Open API Specification (OAS) and provide an API schema for the API in some other form (either in a separate file or as a documentation section within the OAS).<br>- Jan (Ericsson) and Robert Ludovic (Orange) confirmed during the call the agreement reached at TSC.<br><br>Action Item from Telefonica to propose wording for the text to be added to the API Spec in addition to the agreed openId securityScheme. Telefónica will submit proposal this week.<br><br>UPDATE(16/11): Telefónica initial wording proposal already available at [issues/57#issuecomment-1813106499.](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/57#issuecomment-1813106499) |
| [#69](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/69) | Vonage | **Chapter 6 - Front-end flow authorisation flow unauthenticated**<br> As per 04/10 WG call, this issue will be discussed in the context of the GSMA technical stream, and anything that needs to be piggybacked into CAMARA will be raised later for everyone in CAMARA to review. |
| [#70](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/70) | Vonage | **Chapter 6 - Front-end flow PII leakage?**<br> As per 04/10 WG call, this issue will be discussed in the context of the GSMA technical stream, and anything that needs to be piggybacked into CAMARA will be raised later for everyone in CAMARA to review. |
| [#72](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/72) | GSMA | **Have we reached a final ruleset in defining the usage of 2 and 3 legged tokens**<br>- Eric (Vodafone) points out that the Identity & Consent documentation is currently contradictory and leaves the decision to each sub-project. And for example the sim-swap subproject would decide to use client credentials.<br>- Jesús (Telefónica) clarifies that this is not CAMARA's way of working. The Identity and Consent WG is a transversal subproject (like Commonalities), and the agreement reached and documented by its participants must then be taken up and applied in the different API subprojects. And no subproject can make unilateral decisions in this respect.<br>- Jesús encourages the rest of the WG participants to review the issue and check if further action needs to be taken in the documentation to avoid misunderstandings. Or if the issue should otherwise be closed. |
