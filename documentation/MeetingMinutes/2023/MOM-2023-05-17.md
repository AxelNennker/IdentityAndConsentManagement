|  [#11](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/11)  | Centillion | **OpenId vs Mobile Number**<br> Telefonica proposal is to close it as was already discussed. Seems misunderstanding as openID (OIDC) is not a Mobile Number nor even an identifier. Gapask indicates that in a Mobile world, the MSISDN/IMEI/IMSI identify the device. But there could be other identifiers from third parties like GoogleID, Samsung, etc. Deutsche Telekom AG requests clarification about the software identity relation with MNO identity. Gapask indicates that there may be multiple identities, the identity of the user is the one in the MNO, then as a user of the app they may have one identity in the App. The discussion point is whether the different identifiers should be taken into account to build a unique identifier. Deutsche Telekom AG clarifies the identifier would be the one identifying the client (Consuming Application), that has to be valid accross all the operators potentially being aggregated. Telefonica considers there are doubts if this is in scope of this working group, and considers that probably this working group should focus on user identity in the Telco, the one relevant for CAMARA APIs. Vodafone raises the point on whether the identifiers will be the sub in the OIDC token. Indicates that the identifiers in scope should be clarified. Telefonica agrees on need on clarification of valid identifiers, when should be used each of them and how to be used by the CAMARA APIs. Deutsche Telekom AG indicates that the issue should remain open, Telefonica indicates that is misleading because it's not about openid vs mobile number, because are different things. As there is no agreement to close it, issue will remain open. Related with the issue, Deutsche Telekom AG indicated that OpenID Foundation (backing OIDC) will held presentation in Commonalities WG indicating what they see relevant for CAMARA.

| [#12](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/12) ([PR#13](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/13)) | Telefónica | **Baseline Document to describe User Consent Management**<br> Telefonica indicates that is taking into account comments received to the baseline document (including ones in new issues #25 to #28). Intention is to solve most of them and try to have the baseline set to have a starting point, but discussions on every point can continue afterwards. Comments to the PR of the baseline document were reviewed. Regarding comment to not mention OIDC, Telefonica states that that piece was already agreed in commonalities and also in initial meeting of this group. Chris (Vonage) is not in the meeting so discussion will continue offline. Deutsche Telekom AG sends general comment: suggestion/recommendation to check Mobile Connection Framework as OIDC is being used there. Also indicates that PCR was defined as anonymous identifier. Telefonica indicates that given that OIDC is to be used and is existing standard, other initiatives using OIDC can be checked to find how its used. Nevertheless Telefonica considers CAMARA should define its own framework on how to use OIDC, what applies and what not to CAMARA, etc.|

| [#20](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/20)  | Deutsche Telekom AG  | **Application Subscriber Identity**<br> Templates included already, issue can be closed|
| [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/21)  | Deutsche Telekom AG | **Definition of scenarios for consent management**</br> Deutsche Telekom AG indicates that in some document (basline or other) the scenarios regarding consent mgmt should be detailed. Telefonica supports proposal, suggests to initiate including User Stories to define what to be defined and the go to low-level definitions. Orange ask if we want to do it for all scenarios, the ones with expiration time and the ones without it. Some discussion held and agreement seems that all scenarios should be tracked. Orange will create PR to start to work on these scenarios definition, with the approach of defining scenarios in User Story.|

|  [#24](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/24) ([PR#23](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/23)) | Huawei | **Documentation maintenance**<br>  Huawei explain issue. Telefonica recommends to follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/SupportingDocuments/Camara_Versioning_Guidelines.md) set by Commonalities on this matter. Deutsche Telekom AG indicates Current Github PR template includes section changelog input. So instead of updating changelog after each PR merge, it's assumed that the needed content is provided in PRs and can be used to describe the release. It is proposed to leave the CHANGELOG template and restore README files. Huawei will do so.  |
