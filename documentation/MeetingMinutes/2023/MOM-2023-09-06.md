## Issues and PRs

### Review PR [#33](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/33)

- Some commits made by Rafal (Deutsche Telekom), Ludovic (Orange) is aware. Point raised about scenarios appearing in Blockchain API where data access is provided to some MSISDNs. Discussion/progress will continue offline


### Review PR [#55](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/55)

- PR already agreed by Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Telefónica proposes to merge PR and close related issue #45
- Rafal (Deutsche Telekom) notes that the PR does not fully satisfy the issue raised by Shilpa (out of office). Axel (Deutsche Telekom)  asks for further time, until end of week, to double check and raise if there are details that need further clarification. Diego  (Telefonica) says ok, until the end of the week.

| **Issue** | Owner | Description |
| ----------| ----- | ----------- |
| **Open issues** |  |  | 
| [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/21) ([PR#33](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/33))| Deutsche Telekom AG | **Definition of scenarios for consent management**<br> See notes of review of PR #33. |
| [#32](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/32) | Orange | **The concept of purpose**<br> - This is the one having the greatest impact. Complex discussion.<br>- We had discussion in last call about Telefonica proposal on how to solve scenarios. Since then, Orange sent their proposal for resolution of purpose handling in these scenarios. Telefonica says that Orange proposal is not that far from Telefonica proposal, since both agree on the need to have consent and manage purpose.<br>- Orange notes we're far on the granularity aspects, with impact on product side. Diego clarifies that CAMARA scope is focused on endpoint definition and protect the endpoint with scope. But we're not moving further upwards (towards commercial layer) -- out of scope of CAMARA, and product details.<br>- Orange explains their proposal.<br>- Orange also proposes that app request must provide purpose+technical scope. Diego asks -> 1 Product:1 API? Orange: Yes in Orange proposal one CAMARA API is mapped exactly as one OPGW Product. The technical scope is defined in the API yaml at resource/operation level (nothing prevent that one scope can protect two resources). This is already present in CAMARA yaml. Telefonica: 1 product:1 feature protected by a purpose (purpose will be the whole string, left and right of : in e.g.: FraudPreventionAndDetection:location)<br>- Ludovic clarified that having atomic APIs is per business decision/guidance (for example discussion on Device Location). Diego does not agree with this, since the decision of split/merging endpoints is not purely product/business decision, there also exists technical component (mention to subscription/notifications topic).<br>- Discussion also on legal text. Diego still see issues/problems (text predefined) -> this would lead to individual legal text per technical scope, making it difficult to present to end user. Orange disagrees about the issue criticality as preformatted text could be design-time defined for Purpose and for each technical scope. Then runtime the text presented to the end user could be generated on the fly.<br>- Orange insists that the granularity of Product definition is also part of the decision/outcome resulting from issue #32.<br>- Telefonica: with your approach, we are forcing the developer to send each technical scope individually. Orange answers that yes but is should be considered that technical scope are defined in the yaml so de facto know as such by the developer.<br>- Telefonica: not sure how to keep moving forward. The main point is that Telefonica sees more complexity (while Orange sees the opposite). Telefonica position with Telefonica solution is to decouple (as much as possible) from business decisions in the future that may impact existing ones, and would require coming back and modify things.<br>- Telefonica thinks business (on regional markets, e.g. Spain) will define the product as they want over GSMA defined baseline product. We don't want to ask end users for a lot of opt-ins (requirement from our business unit). From Orange perspective the solution proposed by Telefonica has an inherent risk of confusion for developer facing many OPGW product with intersection. As demonstrated by Orange 2 APIs with 2 Resource triggers 15 OPGW product combination (for one given purpose). Telefonica answers that assumption in their proposal is that Telcos in one country will agree to use only a very small subset of possible combinations. Orange doubts about the feasibility of this in one country and more at the level of several countries.<br>- Agreed way forward -> Deutsche Telekom to check both proposals. Orange propose to also escalate the discussion to GSMA Prod WS. Both Orange and Telefonica to double check with their product/business peers. |
