## Baseline document for User Consent Management

TEF presented the document. It was clarified that the intention is to agree on the ToC, identifying any missing points. Upon agreement, new issues (and associated PRs) can be defined, with the aim of i) populating missing sections and ii) modifying existing content, if needed.
- Issue [#12](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/12) ([PR#13](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/13)).
- AP 20230412-01.

TEF went through the ToC, noting that some sections inherit from the old issue we had in Commonalities, which was issue [#60](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/60) ([PR#68](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/68])). At the end of the different sections there are disclaimers to clarify the content that need to be input once agreements are reached in the Sub-Project after discussion. 

**"Purposes" section**. TEF noted the following tenets:
- Purpose is a key concept, and it does not only apply to GDPR. It is generic enough to have a solution qualified not only to EU countries but for any other country.
- Purpose in the document is ellaborated using W3 terminology on data privacy, as suggested by DT some time ago (see issue [#60](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/60)).
- Purpose level is aligned with lawful/legal basis. The document includes a table with the main purpose levels. This table can be extended (or reduced) depending on the outcomes of the discussions to be held in this Sub-Project. 

**"User Authentication/Authorization & Consent Management" section**. TEF noted the following ideas:
- There is content in this section yet. Input to be available upon first agreements resulting from the discussion to be held in this Sub-Project. 
- As for authorization flows, we need to decide case by case, depending on the casuistry of individual APIs: whether Personal Information (PI) is managed with the API, use cases applicable with the API, etc. We can indeed have different grant types and we need to specify which ones are in scope of each API. 

**"User Authentication/Authorization & Consent Management" section**. TEF noted the following ideas:
- There is content in this section yet. Input to be available upon first agreements resulting from the discussion to be held in this Sub-Project. 
- As for consent capture and storage, we might come up with different scenarios. Questions under discussion and that requires checking with legal teams: what is the role of delegated consent in CAMARA? Does it make sense with the scope of on-going service APIs? Is the consent stored in the telco or in a 3rd party?
- As for authorization flows, we need to decide case by case, depending on the casuistry of individual APIs: whether Personal Information (PI) is managed with the API, use cases applicable with the API, etc. We can indeed have different grant types and we need to specify which ones are in scope of each API. 

**"Consent APIs" section**. TEF clarifies that the aim of Consent API is to manage user consents, if and when required. A clear example is when consent is captured by a 3rd party and need to be stored in the telco operator. In such a case, the telco operator needs to make this API available for consumption to the 3rd party. 



Ike: user consent solutions avialable in 3GPP specs.
- Jesús: we have seen your mails and see the material contained therein. After early assessment, we realize that user handling at API level might be different than how it is done at the mobile network resource layer (3GPP). Relation with Tom (GSMA) question on UNI.
- Jose: my early assessment is that this is a 3GPP specific solution tied to 5G-Advanced capabilities, which are far from being available (at least at large scale) in the short term. From CAMARA we pretend to be more pragmatic, trying to build on solutions that i) are ready for commercial launch in the short-term, and ii) are appropriate for consumption by CAMARA consumers, i.e. developers. This means that we are looking for solutions that are simple, developer-friendly and with semantics tailored to the specific operational and business needs of these consumers (while being compliant with the regulation in force). And the 3GPP solutions you pointed out below do not seem to fulfil neither i) nor ii).


## Q&A session
The following table summarizes the main discussion that was held after document presentation.  

| Company | Q/A | Comments |
| ---- | ---| ------- | 
| **Topic: Consent API** | |
| GSMA | Q | Suggested the possibility to use the API from application to trigger consent capture by the operator. |
| Telefónica | A | From TEF point of view, consent capture should be part of the authorization flow. But it is not a "closed door" for this proposal if we found the need for CAMARA.|
| GSMA | Q | What is the scenario applicable to user consent API?|
| Telefónica | A | The marketplace/app asks the user to provide the consent; as soon as the user provides the requested consent, the marketplace/app shall let the telco operator know that the user has provided consent for a given purpose. To that end, the marketplace/app invokes the consent API, sending in the API call the consent, so that the telco operator can store it. Our baseline proposal is to go for OIDC flow.|
| GSMA | Q | Consent grant at run time, at setup time, or both of them?|
| Telefónica | A | It is something that is not in real time|
| Vodafone | Q | The same API can have different use cases, each requiring different consent types |
| Telefónica | A | Each use case might have a different purpose. For example, we can have one use case without requiring explicit user action and another use case (opt-in purpose) which requires explicit user consent. Applications should be aware of the purpose to access the API, and depending on the purpose type, authorization flows may apply or not. |
| **Topic: User consent management** | |
| GSMA | Q | Should we have a section touching on solutions that can be used for consent capture between device and network? This mainly applies for UNI interface, though GSMA is not sure whether UNI is in scope of CAMARA or not (probably not).  |
| Telefónica | A | As pointed out when presenting the ToC, we need to assess authorization flows API by API, to assess the actual casuistry (e.g., PI usage, use cases, etc.) around the actual API. In this regard, we can go for different solutions (OTP, webview, etc.). We also need to consided the UX in the solution design.|
| DT| Q | Plenty of work has been already done in GSMA Mobile Connect (MC). Consent handling and authentication issues discussed in MC group are well documented in GSMA -- it worths having a look at the material.| 
| Telefónica | A | Feel free to open an issue in the Sub-Project on this topic, and provide a MC-based solution for CAMARA use cases and requirements.  |
| Alicon | Q | Claim there are plenty of solutions available in 3GPP specifications, most of them in scope of 5G-Advanced. They refer to the documentation and material provided via mail -- it is only a portion of the e2e vision, further references can be shared if needed. | 
| Telefónica | A | Confirm that TEF delegates have seen documentation shared via mail, and thanks Ike for providing this material. After early assessment, TEF realize that user handling at API level might be different than how it is done at the mobile network resource layer (3GPP). Most of user handling solutions captured in 3GPP requires involvement between UE and the network -- relation with GSMA question on UNI interface. <br> TEF do not however understand how 3GPP-based proposed solutions solve CAMARA scenario were we have dev-friendly APIs exposed through an Open Gateway. This Open Gateway is not in 3GPP scope, but logically placed in upper layers -- precisely because one of the goals of CAMARA is to hide the specificities and complexity of 3GPP managed network resources. <br>Our early assessment is that the 3GPP solutions captured in the material you shared belong to 5G-Advanced, and thus are far from being available (at least at large scale) in the short term. From CAMARA we pretend to be more pragmatic, trying to build on solutions that i) are ready for commercial launch in the short-term, and ii) are appropriate for consumption by developers. This means that we are looking for solutions that are simple, developer-friendly and with semantics tailored to the specific operational and business needs of these consumers (while being compliant with the regulation in force). And the 3GPP solutions you pointed out below do not seem to fulfil neither i) nor ii). <br> Nonetheless, TEF clarify that this is contribution-driven, and if Alicon thinks these 3GPP solution deserve further discussion and exploration, Alicon can open a new issue in the Sub-Project and continue discussion in this new issue.|
