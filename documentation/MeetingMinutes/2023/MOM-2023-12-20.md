## Agenda

1. OpenID Foundation (OIDF) presentation slot (20min presentation, 10min Q&A): 
   -  _"The plan is for OIDF to give an overview of the [FAPI Security Profile](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0.html), as well as the [OIDF certification program](https://openid.net/certification/) and discuss how we can create the Opengateway/CAMARA OIDC profile to cover the implementation topics that have been raised as issues in the WG and other different tracks (not only CAMARA but also GSMA and others) such as mandatory parameters in the Authorize request, CIBA login_hint vs login-hint_token, client secret vs private_key_jwt, etc."_
      -  Related issues: [#78](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/78), [#90](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/90)

    - **Discussion on Issue #57 "Align securitySchemes and security of CAMARA API specs with IdentityAndConsentManagement WG".**
      - Related Issue #96 "securitySchemas and security of CAMARA APIs should reside in the API specification as it is part of API lifecycle".
    - **Discussion on Issue #70 "Front-end flow PII leakage?".**
    - **Discussion on Issue #100 "Claims to be used in oAuth Access tokens".** (Added at the request of Ericsson)

## OIDF presentation

- Presentation of the OIDF team to introduce the FAPI profile and certification program in OIDF.
- Q&A session with OIDF team and CAMARA participants:
  - **Q1:** _"Do you recommend using FAPI as the basis for the Opengateway/CAMARA OIDC profile? FAPIv1 is mentioned as being "too complex" and FAPIv2 is in the works..."_
    - OIDF: FAPI is a good starting point. FAPI2 is pretty close to the final state. Bjorn mentioned that there are two options: Leverage on FAPI WG or leverage on Mobile Connect.
  - **Q2:** _"You mentioned CIBA FAPI profile, in CAMARA we are currently working with three different AuthZ flows (Auth code, CIBA and Client Credentials). Could the Opengateway/CAMARA OIDCD profile be generic or different per AuthZ flow?"_
    - OIDF: It is fine and possible to have a generic profile. Bjorn points out that CIBA was developed for the MODRNA WG and then used in FAPI. Each WG using CIBA will create its profile and select what will be applicable. CIBA FAPI, CIBA MODRNA, CAMARA will be new.
  - **Q3:** _"What would be the expected timeline to generate an Opengateway/CAMARA profile? How long would it take?"_
    - OIDF: Using FAPI as an example, the timeline would be on the order of years.
  - **Q4:** _"- In your experience, what would be the next steps if CAMARA decided to develop an OIDC profile? Will the Foundation be responsible for its development?"_
    - OIDF: OIDF advocates taking responsibility for developing such a profile, as the expertise within the Foundation would provide CAMARA with the knowledge base and experience to help develop the profile. The Foundation has already had experience with this approach of creating profiles for specific implementations of various OpenID Foundation specifications.

| **Open issues** |  |  | 
| [#21](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/21) ([PR#74](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/74)) `Draft`| Deutsche Telekom AG | **Definition of scenarios for consent management**<br>It is on hold at the moment. No updates from last call. |
| [#57](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/57) ([PR#62](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/62)) `Draft` ([PR#93](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/93)) | Telefonica | **Align securitySchemes and security of CAMARA API specs with IdentityAndConsentManagement WG**<br><li>Jesús (Telefónica) mentions that PR #93 has been created to formalize in the WG documentation the final agreement reached by the TSC and the WG participants.<li>It is also mentioned that the point raised by Eric (Vodafone) to update the "CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md" document to list client credentials as a valid authorization scheme for some scenarios has also been addressed in the PR.<li>Additional change suggestion from Shilpa (DT) to include a link to CAMARA-AuthN-AuthZ-Concept.md to avoid "duplicate" information is also discussed. Jesús (Telefónica) mentions that based on past experience, he thinks it would be better to explicitly include the information in "CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md" to avoid misunderstandings. Shilpa mentions that the document CAMARA-AuthN-AuthZ-Concept.md may be obsolete in future revisions.<li>Final agreement to add Shilpa's suggested additional text to the document (Jesus will do a new commit in PR).<li>Then final review and approval is expected to merge the PR and close the issue.<li>As per [TSC 07/12 meeting](https://wiki.camaraproject.org/display/CAM/2023-12-07+TSC+Minutes) conclusion, `securitySchemas` and `security` agreed solution in this issue will not be re-discussed again. |
| [#69](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/69) | Vonage | **Chapter 6 - Front-end flow authorisation flow unauthenticated**<br> As per 04/10 WG call, this issue will be discussed in the context of the GSMA technical stream, and anything that needs to be piggybacked into CAMARA will be raised later for everyone in CAMARA to review. |
| [#70](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/70) ([PR#86](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/86)) | Vonage | **Chapter 6 - Front-end flow PII leakage?**<br><li>Eric's (Vodafone) change proposal in PR #86 to clarify the text on consent capture is reviewed. It is agreed to change the wording according to Eric's proposal. PR already updated.<li>Axel's (DT) comments about the PR changes not being aligned with the OIDC standard are discussed.<li> Jesús (Telefónica) mentions that this PR replicates the exact same changes made in the GSMA documentation according to the solution agreed in Opengateway where the issue was originally open (by Vonage due to PII leakage concerns) and where it was decided to discuss the issue. The final process was agreed in GSMA months ago and is already being implemented by Opengateway participants. So it is not as simple as changing this PR in CAMARA. There are timelines and formal procedures to follow and Jesus mentioned that this PR should be merged "as is" as part of the v0.1 release according to the existing agreements.<li>Axel points out that the sentence needs to be removed because it deviates from OIDC. The authorization request should result in an error if the user does not agree.<li>Jesus points out that the OIDC spec is not 100% clear on this, and he can imagine scenarios where multiple scopes are requested (not all of which require user consent), and if the user does not consent to one of them, the auth server would still issue an access token containing the remaining scopes.<li>Shilpa (DT) says that if it was agreed in OpenGateway, it does not mean that it has to be agreed in CAMARA.<li>Some additional discussion about where we are now and the problem: CAMARA should not just accept without discussion, agreement in GSMA implies there are implementations, this is in repo since 1 month, etc.. No clear conclusion...<li>Then, the flow and options are discussed, Elisabeth (Ericsson) raises questions to clarify the understanding. Elisabeth indicates that the behavior described in PR is fine, also Pedro (Telefónica) explains the behavior and links to OAuth2 spec indicating this behavior is valid.<li>No final agreement. |

| [#82](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/82) | Orange | **Redundancy with GSMA API General Federated Call Flows document**<br>This issue was not specifically addressed on today's call, but was mentioned as part of other topic discussions. There is still no final resolution to this issue. |
