# Identity And Consent Management documentation

### Overview

* High level description:
    * Operator (NaaS) platform implementing CAMARA APIs should be built with a privacy-by-default approach to fully comply with data protection regulations like the GDPR regulation in Europe, which emphasises on user's privacy. 
    * These regulations note that some CAMARA APIs may require user consent to be accessed. 
    * This forces the operators to provide means and appropriate solutions to capture, store and manage this consent through its lifecycle. 
    * Otherwise, the scoped CAMARA APIs cannot be rolled out in production networks.
    * Building such a solution also means bringing in scope the identity of the end user and/or the subscriber (as both could be different) and making sure that end user experience of using the API is not compromised while doing so.
